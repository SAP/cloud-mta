<b>Disclaimer</b>: The MTA explorer services is under heavy development and is currently in a `pre-alpha` stage.
                   Some functionality is still missing and the APIs are subject to change; use at your own risk.
                   
# MTA Explorer Services

MTA tool for exploring and validating the multi-target application descriptor (`mta.yaml`).

The tool commands (APIs) are used to do the following:

   - Explore the structure of the `mta.yaml` file objects, such as retrieving a list of resources required by a specific module.
   - Validate an `mta.yaml` file against a specified schema version.
   - Ensure semantic correctness of an `mta.yaml` file, such as the uniqueness of module/resources names, the resolution of requires/provides pairs, and so on.
   - Validate the descriptor against the project folder structure, such as the `path` attribute reference in an existing project folder.
   - Get data for constructing a deployment MTA descriptor, such as deployment module types.
   

### Multi-Target Applications

A multi-target application is a package comprised of multiple application and resource modules that have been created using different technologies and deployed to different run-times; however, they have a common life cycle. A user can bundle the modules together using the `mta.yaml` file, describe them along with their inter-dependencies to other modules, services, and interfaces, and package them in an MTA project.
 
## Roadmap 

### Milestone 1 
 
 - [x] Supports the MTA parser 
 - [x] Supports development descriptor schema validations (2.1) 
 - [ ] Supports semantic validations (MTA->project)
 - [ ] Supports ‘path’ validation
 
### Milestone 2
 
- [ ] Supports semantic validations (MTA)
- [ ] Supports uniqueness of module and resource names
- [ ] Supports multiple schema support
- [ ] Supports advanced `mta.yaml` file (3.1, 3.2) schemas support
 
### Milestone 3
- [ ] Supports updating scenarios, such as add module/resource, add module property, add dependency, and so on
- [ ] Supports placeholder resolution

## Installation

To install the package, first you need to install Go and set your Go workspace.

Download and install it:

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/mta-explorer/mta
```

## Usage

 - Import it into your source code:

```go
import "github.com/mta-explorer/mta"
```

 -  Quick start example:

```go
// Sets the path to the MTA project.
mp := mta.Loc{SourcePath: “wd/my_mta_project”}
// Returns an MTA object.
m, err := mta.ParseFile(&mp)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
// Returns the module properties.
module, err := m.GetModuleByName(moduleName)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```
